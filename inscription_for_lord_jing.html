                  <p>In the second year of Han'an Reign (143 C.E.)</p>
                  <p>autumn □□</p>
                  <p>Lord Jing, the former governor of Ren County in Beihai Commandery passed away.</p>
                  <p>Alas, how grievous!</p>
                  <p>The state □□ treasure</p>
                  <p>The outstanding scholars lost their peer.</p>
                  <p>All constellations lost the essence</p>
                  <p>The latter scholars and the pupils are late in time.</p>
                  <p>Upon where does Heaven</p>
                  <p>Arranges the Fate and confers the term.</p>
                  <p>There is life and there is death</p>
                  <p>Heaven indeed controls it.</p>
                  <p>How could that benevolent sage</p>
                  <p>Be cut down with no remain.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the former subordinates and students</p>
                  <p>discussed with each other, said:</p>
                  <p>As for the great figures of the ancient times</p>
                  <p>None of which failed to shed light □ infinity,</p>
                  <p>Spread fragrance and radiance to the records and pieces.</p>
                  <p>Even if the physical self is dead, the deeds are clear</p>
                  <p>Even if the body perished, the name continues to exist.</p>
                  <p>Some have their figures pictured on the graphs,</p>
                  <p>Some have the odes stroked on the winds and strings.</p>
                  <p>The latecomers chant their contributions,</p>
                  <p>Their achievements are recounted on bamboos slips and silks.</p>
                  <p>Thus composed the dirge, which says:</p>

               <div class="main-content-translation">
                  <p>Prostrating and thinking of the Enlightened Repositor,</p>
                  <p>Who received his nature from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Faithful and deeply virtuous,</p>
                  <p>He followed the rituals and carried out humaneness.</p>
                  <p>He pursued the Way and followed the norm,</p>
                  <p>He cherished the pureness and kept the natural property.</p>
                  <p>Bright and white, clear and upright</p>
                  <p>He subdued the self and cultivated himself.</p>
                  <p>Truly he was gentle and truly he was firm,</p>
                  <p>A master of sword and pen.</p>
                  <p>Following father he attended the examination of filial piety,</p>
                  <p>He received the informal position of Chamberlain for the National Treasury.</p>
                  <p>Shedding his virtue to Yuan County,</p>
                  <p>He procured profits and benefitted the people.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon the brutal subordinates changed their behaviors,</p>
                  <p>The cornered and feeble ones were covered in benevolence.</p>
                  <p>He had the prestige established and the beneficence scattered,</p>
                  <p>He cultivated conducts as if he was a deity.</p>
                  <p>The emperor admired his deeds,</p>
                  <p>Summoned him with the tally and decree.</p>
                  <p>To guard the commanderies of Yi Region,</p>
                  <p>The journey was far and he was concerned about his parents.</p>
                  <p>He bent to the marquise and modestly declined</p>
                  <p>Day and night serving the imperial court.</p>
                  <p>He proposed loyal and upright advice,</p>
                  <p>He distinguished the order in the eastern hillside.</p>
                  <p>The imperial signet superadded the official appointment,</p>
                  <p>He occupied the position of the Counselor of Beihai Commandery</p>
                  <p>He governed nineteen cities,</p>
                  <p>The neighboring countries inclined toward him.</p>
                  <p>Clearly demarcated the good and the wicked, </p>
                  <p>He prioritized with respect and concession.</p>
                  <p>The demolished and the falsified changed mind,</p>
                  <p>The light and cunning exceeded competition.</p>
                  <p>The owls did not cry,</p>
                  <p>The parted children returned to serve the parents.</p>
                  <p>Multitudes of the widowers and the widows,</p>
                  <p>They got tranquility because of the blessings.</p>
                  <p>He accumulated the Way and cultivated his virtue,</p>
                  <p>□ blessedness to achieve prosperity.</p>
                  <p>As for the myriad esteemed rituals, </p>
                  <p>The Enlightened Repositor carried them out.</p>
                  <p>As for Benevolence and righteousness, the Way and the tactics,</p>
                  <p>The Enlightened Repositor embraced them.</p>
                  <p>As for Huang Zhu and Father Shao,</p>
                  <p>The Enlightened Repositor joined to be the third of them.</p>
                  <p>As for the official position of the Three Dukes and the buttresses,</p>
                  <p>The Enlightened Repositor is suitable for them.</p>
                  <p>In the illness he was summoned,</p>
                  <p>He entrusted the official post and resigned.</p>
                  <p>His people □ thought of him ardently,</p>
                  <p>People from far and near scratched their heads in agitation.</p>
                  <p>The farmers put down the plow,</p>
                  <p>The tradesmen left the markets empty,</p>
                  <p>With every entirety swallowed the tears.</p>
                  <p>How come the imperial court,</p>
                  <p>Deprived me of my caring father?</p>
                  <p>Within ten days after he retired from the office, </p>
                  <p>His disease became severe and concerning.</p>
                  <p>The substance of jade-tablet and jade-disc,</p>
                  <p>Could not be retrieved On the verge of death.</p>
                  <p>The voices of the woeful whining could not stop,</p>
                  <p>He passed away suddenly with no delay.</p>
                  <p>The filial sons crashed and collided,</p>
                  <p>Toppled and broken as if he was torn apart.</p>
                  <p>No longer could he be awaken,</p>
                  <p>He has returned forever to the underworld.</p>
                  <p>The villagers of the households and people in the prefecture,</p>
                  <p>Ran to the funeral with tears dripping.</p>
                  <p>The former subordinates were distressed,</p>
                  <p>Sobbing and hovering, again and again.</p>
                  <p>The established scholars with caps and canopies around the state,</p>
                  <p>Were startled and grieved full of sorrow.</p>
                  <p>That which has the Great Fate fixed, </p>
                  <p>Truly it is only given by Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The enlightened ruler set up the position,</p>
                  <p>The Enlightened Repositor would not take it.</p>
                  <p>The vassals and sons desire to serve,</p>
                  <p>The Enlightened Repositor would not remain.</p>
                  <p>Alas, how grievous!</p>
               </div>
               <div class="coda-translation">
                  <p>The coda says:</p>

                  <p>He should be promoted to join the tripod vassals,</p>
                  <p>To fasten the trunk of the pine. Oh!</p>
                  <p>Not eternal is his lifespan, </p>
                  <p>He left the vassals and sons behind. Oh!</p>
                  <p>His benevolence reaches Bohai and Mountain Tai, </p>
                  <p>People composed Gan Tang for you. Oh!</p>
